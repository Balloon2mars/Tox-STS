Single Tox Standard
===

Due to the nature of Tox, clients and other various services have the freedom to name components as they wish. To promote the Tox brand more efficiently, as well as keeping the user experience a simple one, we **require** that all clients who wish to be licensed to use the phrase "Tox client" or use our logo and its derivatives  abide by the STS: Single Tox Standard. This will afford users a smooth transition from client-to-client, ensure clients stay feature complete, and promote a single, cohesive brand.
