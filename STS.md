Single Tox Standard Draft v.0.0.2
===

###User Identification
- Users exchange a 76-character string that contains a public key, a nospam value, and a checksum to be used as an identifier. This is to be called the **Tox ID**. "User ID", "ID", and other derivatives are not valid and fail to follow the STS. 
- Users can set a *Name* to present a quick way of identification once the friend request has been accepted. These names may be changed on-the-fly and do not alter the Tox ID in anyway. "Username", "Nick", and other derivatives are not valid and fail to follow the STS.


###Friend Requests
There are three fields a Tox client must offer when a user goes to add another. While two of these fields are optional for the end-user to fill out, it is required that Tox clients provide all three fields in the UI. These are, and should be labeled as, as follows: <stuff here>




## Translation of STS Terminology
Client developers must choose translations that resemble the English variations as closely as possible, except in the case where the Tox trademark is being used. For example, Tox ID is to remain, untouched, in English. In the future, we will provide translations to be used in non-English Tox clients.
