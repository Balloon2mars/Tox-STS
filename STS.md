Single Tox Standard Draft v.0.0.1
===

###User Identification
- Users exchange a 76-character string that contains a public key, a nospam value, and a checksum to be used as an identifier. This is to be called the **Tox ID**. "User ID", "ID", and other derivatives are not valid and fail to follow the STS. 
- Users can set a *Nickname* or just *Name* within Tox to present a quick way of identification once the friend request has been accepted. These names may be changed on-the-fly and do not alter the Tox ID in anyway. "Username", "Nick", and other derivatives are not valid and fail to follow the STS.
